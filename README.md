Backup & Encrypt: A simple bash script that backs up a user-defined folder into a user-defined folder, compresses the contents, encrypts the .tar with GPG, then deletes the unencrypted copied files, leaving an encrypted backup of your directory.

Usage: ./backup2.sh

Enter your source folder,
Enter your destination folder,
Enter your PGP key.
